# Led-Blinking-with-PIC18 f46 k20
## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for implementing LED blinking interfacing with PIC 18 microcontroller. The project aims to demonstrate the fundamental concept of controlling LEDs using PIC 18 and connecting them to Port C.

## Features
Basic LED blinking program for PIC 18
LEDs connected to Port C for demonstration
Clear documentation and code comments for easy understanding

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine and demonstrate LED blinking with PIC 18.


## Prerequisites
PIC 18 microcontroller
MPLAB X IDE
PICKit programmer
LEDs
Resistors (if necessary)
Breadboard (if necessary)
Jumper wires
Installation
Hardware Setup:

## Installation
Hardware Setup:

Connect the LEDs to Port C of your PIC 18 microcontroller. Ensure proper polarity and current limiting resistors if needed.
Software Setup:

Download and install MPLAB X IDE for your operating system.
Connect your PICKit programmer to your computer and the PIC 18 microcontroller.
Open MPLAB X IDE and create a new project for PIC 18.
Copy the provided source code (led_blinking_pic18.c) into your project folder.
Compile and Upload the Code:

Compile the source code in MPLAB X IDE to generate the hex file.
Use PICKit programmer to upload the hex file to your PIC 18 microcontroller.

## Usage
Once the code is uploaded, the LEDs connected to Port C of your PIC 18 microcontroller should start blinking according to the programmed pattern.
