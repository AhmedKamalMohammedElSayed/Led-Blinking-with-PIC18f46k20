# Led-Blinking-with-PIC18 f46 k20
Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine and demonstrate LED blinking with PIC 18.

##Prerequisites
PIC 18 microcontroller
MPLAB X IDE
PICKit programmer
LEDs
Resistors (if necessary)
Breadboard (if necessary)
Jumper wires
Installation
Hardware Setup:

Connect the LEDs to Port C of your PIC 18 microcontroller. Ensure proper polarity and current limiting resistors if needed.
Software Setup:

Download and install MPLAB X IDE for your operating system.
Connect your PICKit programmer to your computer and the PIC 18 microcontroller.
Open MPLAB X IDE and create a new project for PIC 18.
Copy the provided source code (led_blinking_pic18.c) into your project folder.
Compile and Upload the Code:

Compile the source code in MPLAB X IDE to generate the hex file.
Use PICKit programmer to upload the hex file to your PIC 18 microcontroller.
Usage
Once the code is uploaded, the LEDs connected to Port C of your PIC 18 microcontroller should start blinking according to the programmed pattern.
